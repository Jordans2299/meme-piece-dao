Meme Piece DAO


Build Instructions:
npm install
npm start


Background:
Meme piece dao is a fun side project I worked on following the tutorial project from buildspace. The point of the DAO is to build a community around people that want to share One Piece memes. As of now when I user connects their Metamask wallet and clicks to join they receive a meme piece NFT signifying that they are members of the DAO. Once they are a member they are taken to the member page where they can view, vote on, and submit proposals to benefit the DAO community. Additionally, by being a part of the community members are periodically given Nakama tokens which in turn provides more tenured members more voting power.
